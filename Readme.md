# HTML5 Bundle

A collection of HTML5 and other snippets I've found useful which aren't included in the default HTML bundle. HTML5 is used loosely, mainly to distinguish itself from the default bundle.

Includes:

+ HTML5 doctype templates
+ Google hosted code library links
+ HTML5 element snippets (Video, Audio, Article, Header, etc.)
+ more

Some of the snippets are from the mHTML bundle available from [Minimal Designs](http://minimaldesign.net/downloads/tools/textmate-html-bundle).

## How To Install

**Using git**

Open Terminal and navigate to the Textmate application support folder, i.e.

`cd Users/Your\ Name/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/`

Clone the git repository

`git clone git@github.com:rlayte/HTML5-Textmate-Bundle.git html5.tmbundle`

Reload the bundles either from the Textmate menu or

`osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'`

**Without git**

+ click on the download soruce link near the top of the page.
+ unzip and rename folder to html5.tmbundle
+ double click on the bundle
