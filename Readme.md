A collection of snippets I've found useful which aren't included in the default HTML bundle.

Some of the snippets are from the mHTML bundle available from [Minimal Designs](http://minimaldesign.net/downloads/tools/textmate-html-bundle).

## How To Install
-----------------

Open Terminal and navigate to the Textmate Application Resource folder, i.e.

`Users/Your\ Name/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/`

Clone the git repository

`git clone git@github.com:rlayte/HTML-5-Textmate-Bundle.git`
