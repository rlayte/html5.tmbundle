# HTML5 Bundle

A collection of HTML5 and other snippets I've found useful which aren't included in the default HTML bundle. HTML5 is used loosely, mainly to distinguish itself from the default bundle.

Some of the snippets are from the mHTML bundle available from [Minimal Designs](http://minimaldesign.net/downloads/tools/textmate-html-bundle).

## How To Install

Open Terminal and navigate to the Textmate application support folder, i.e.

`Users/Your\ Name/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles/`

Clone the git repository

`git clone git@github.com:rlayte/HTML-5-Textmate-Bundle.git`

Reload the bundles either from the Textmate menu or

`osascript -e 'tell app "TextMate" to reload bundles'`
